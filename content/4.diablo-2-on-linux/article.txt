# Installing Diablo II on Linux

Isn't it great when a game just works in Linux? Guess what, Diablo II is one of those
privileged few. Which is good, because it makes for great LAN parties and still
retains its awesome gameplay after well over 10 years.
So if you have a PC running Linux on your network, fear not: here's how to install it.
It's actually refreshingly painless.

## Setting up Wine

First, install and set up Wine, a Windows-like environment for running Windows programs
within Linux. If don't have it already, it will most likely be available as a package from your distro.
For example, on Ubuntu you'd type `apt-get install wine`. On Arch, `pacman -S wine`. Et cetera.
To set up Wine once it's installed, run `winecfg`.

Wine keeps a virtual C: drive, which by default is at `~/.wine/drive_c`.
You can create other drives and link them (as well as Windows folders like My Documents)
to places in your Linux filesystem. For our purposes, all we have to do is add a CD drive.
To do this, go to winecfg's *Drives* tab, click *Add...* and select a drive letter.
Then, with that drive selected, enter in the *Path* field the point in your filesystem that Wine should treat as that drive.
Personally, I have my install CDs backed up as ISO disc images, which I mount as follows:
`mount -o loop /path/to/disc_image.iso /media/iso`.
So I'll add a virtual D: drive in Wine with the image mount point (which in my case is `/media/iso`) as the path.
If you're using physical CDs, then do the same thing, but use `/media/cd` or whatever your CD mount point is.
(Check `/etc/fstab` if you're not sure.)
Oh, I almost forgot, there's an *Autodetect...* button on the Drives tab that will try to do all of that automatically.
You should probably just click that.

You'll also want to set up sound, which is a matter of going to the *Audio* tab and selecting a driver
(ALSA or OSS, depending on what you have installed). You might have to trial-and-error this a bit;
ALSA works for me on Arch but I seem to remember having to pick OSS in the past.
I also remember having to change *Hardware Acceleration* to *Emulation* as well,
so if you still have problems, try that.

What else? Some window managers in Linux have the option to grab and move windows by alt-clicking them.
If you end up running the game in a window, and you have such an option set in your WM,
it might conflict with using the alt key to highlight and pick up items in Diablo.
The solution is to go to the *Graphics* tab in `winecfg` and uncheck
*Allow the window manager to control the windows*.
(Of course, if you do this, don't expect it to behave exactly the same as your other windows;
e.g., if you minimize the game, it won't appear on your taskbar,
but will become a small icon on your desktop instead).
If the conflict still happens after that (and it has on occasion for me), you'll have to reassign the key in your WM.

## Existing install

If you already have Diablo II on an existing Windows partition, I've found you can run it through Wine
pretty easily. You'll have to set your preferences again though, as they won't be in your Wine registry yet.
(This ought to work the other way around, too, if you want to copy a Wine installation onto a Windows system.)
You can then skip the next section. Otherwise, read on...

## Installing through Wine

So now you can insert your Diablo II install CD or mount your image thereof, navigate to the mount point, and run
`wine setup.exe`. Hit install, enter your CD key, and it should start installing.
Switch discs when prompted, or if you're using disc images, unmount the current one
(i.e. `umount /media/iso`) and mount the next one.
Afterwards, if you want to install the Lord of Destruction expansion
(and why wouldn't you?), mount that disc and repeat.

Then it's time to patch the game. Download the latest patch if you haven't already,
navigate to its directory, and run it with Wine: `wine D2Patch_113c.exe`
(or `wine LODPatch_113c.exe` if you installed the expansion).
After that, you have the option of copying over a couple more files manually
so that you don't have to insert the CD or mount the image whenever you want to play.
Insert or mount the game disc and copy `d2music.mpq` to your game directory
(e.g. `~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Diablo\ II`, or wherever you chose to install it).
If you installed the expansion, insert or mount that disc and copy `d2xmusic.mpq` and `d2xvideo.mpq` as well.

## Setting up the video driver

Last, you should switch to your game directory and run `wine D2VidTst.exe`.
The game will detect compatible video modes and give you a choice of which one to use.
These days, Direct3D seems to work on my computer without any hassle.
However, I seem to remember having trouble with it in the past, so if that's the case,
Direct2D might give you more luck. You'll lose features like the 3D perspective view this way, though.

As a third option, you could try this [Glide wrapper](http://www.svenswrapper.de/english/downloads.html),
which emulates an old-school 3dfx Voodoo card. Download it, open the archive
and drop `glide3x.dll` into your game directory, run `wine D2VidTst.exe` again and choose 3dfx Glide.

I've found that sometimes running fullscreen doesn't seem to work very well off the bat,
especially on widescreen monitors. The bottom of the screen might be cut off,
or the image might be stretched out horizontally.
If you're using the Glide wrapper as mentioned above, a solution exists.
From the same archive that `glide3x.dll` came from, extract `glide-init.exe`
into the game directory and run it with Wine.
This brings up a configuration window; hit the *settings* button and check *desktopresolution*.
Try it again and hopefully it'll be at the right aspect ratio, fit to the centre of the screen.
By the way, this fix also works in Windows.

If running fullscreen doesn't work at all, or it's unbearably slow,
you can always run the game in windowed mode (see below).

## Fine tuning

That's it. You can play now. Almost.

To play, switch to your Diablo game directory and run `wine Diablo\ II.exe`
(or make a short shell script to do this, from a more convenient location).
You might have to smooth out a couple more things, though...

If you want to run the game in a window, add `-w` to the end of that command.

If it runs slowly and you want to save some CPU cycles, try prepending `WINEDEBUG=-all`
to the beginning of the command. This will disable debugging messages that normally get logged to stdout.

In some situations, the mouse cursor will still appear over top of the game after you run it.
This happened to me when I was running Ubuntu, and it's highly annoying.
An acceptable workaround I found is to install Unclutter,
a small program that removes the cursor after a period of not moving it.
Install it (`apt-get install unclutter`) and run `unclutter -idle 1 &` before running Diablo.
`-idle 1` sets it to remove the cursor after 1 second, and `&` runs it in the background.
If you're using a shell script to run Diablo, just put this at the beginning.

If you want to play over a network, make sure you have a proper setting for your own computer
in your /etc/hosts file, such as `127.0.0.1 localhost`, or `[192.168.x.x] [hostname]`,
where the first is your local IP address and the second is your computer's hostname.

## Commence killing things

Have fun clicking on monsters until they die. See you when Diablo III comes out.

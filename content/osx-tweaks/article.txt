title: Mac OS X Tweaks

content:
Gonna write an OS X guide, just like Windows and Linux.

Mostly terminal and command-line stuff. Also a few useful shortcuts, maybe.

Here's one that sets the font smoothing level. A lower number means lighter,
higher means heavier. I found the default in 10.6 to be too heavy, so I set it
to 1. This is the default:

`defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2`

# My own favourite Windows 7 tweaks

## Installing from a USB drive

Yeah, you can do this. Once you copy over the contents of the CD, you have to set the active partition
on the USB drive. Do this by running `diskpart` from a command line. Then type:

- `list disk` to find the disk number
- `select disk` *`x`* where `x` is the disk number
- likewise, `list partition` and `select partition` *`x`* ... probably 1
- `active`

to select the main partition on the USB drive and make it the active (i.e., bootable) one.

You might also have to go to the USB drive's **\boot** directory and type `bootsect /nt60 x:`,
where `x` is its drive letter. After this, you should be able to boot into Setup on the USB drive.

## Installing to a secondary hard drive

Just kidding! You can't do this directly. I tried.
Windows Setup gives you a list of disks and partitions to install to,
but if you pick a disk that isn't the first disk listed in your BIOS, the install will fail halfway through...
**after** the first reboot. It also has to be installed to the active partition on that drive.
(Neat fact: if you want to, say, run `diskpart` while you're in Setup, Shift-F10 will open a command prompt.)

However, if you want to run a dual-boot with Windows on a secondary drive,
you should be able to switch the Windows drive to the lead drive in BIOS for
the duration of the install process, and then afterward switch back so the other one boots by default.
Then of course you'd get to the Windows drive via the bootloader on your other drive, or whatever.

## Changing the login background

God, that default background on the login/logout screen is ugly. And of course there's no dialog to change it.
Here's how you do it.

Take a JPEG file of your own image and save it to
**C:\Windows\System32\oobe\info\backgrounds**.
Rename it **backgroundDefault.jpg** and it will resize to your resolution.
Or you can drop images in more than one size and rename them **background1600x1200.jpg**,
**background1920x1080.jpg**, etc. to have specific versions for a specific resolutions and/or aspect ratios.

Catch #1: The image has to be under 256k in size or Windows will ignore it.

Catch #2: You either have to make a change to Group Policy or tweak a registry setting.

- Method A: If you have a version of Windows that includes the Local Group Policy Editor
(that'd be Business, Enterprise or Ultimate), run *gpedit.msc*,
go to **Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Logon** and enable
**Always use custom logon background**.
- Method B: Fire up *regedit*, go to
**HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\LogonUI\Background**
and set **OEMBackground** to 1.

## Actually get rid of huge Windows apps

I don't explore the internet with Internet Explorer, nor do I use Windows Media Player to play
my media. Still, I thought I was stuck staring at their useless icons as long as I was running Windows.
Nope. Go to *Control Panel* > *Programs and Features*, which is the place to go for uninstalling stuff.
You can't exactly remove IE and WMP like you would other programs, but if you click the link on the sidebar
that says *Turn Windows features on or off*, you can deactivate these and several other features
that you may or may not ever use. (Maybe you weren't sick of Minesweeper by 1993, but I was.)
Likewise, there are also some useful features you can activate there that aren't turned on by default.
For example...

## Seeing Linux network shares

Finally, I figured this one out. I could see Windows shares from Linux, but not vice versa.
The solution is part of the above-mentioned *Windows Features* menu.
The thing we're looking for is *Services for NFS*, and specifically *Client for NFS*.
Enable that and finally Windows can see Samba shares on boxes running Linux.
